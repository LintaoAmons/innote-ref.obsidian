If there's no `REF` in current line, then insert a new `REF` at the line end.
Else jump to next `REF`.

### Jump to previews

Jump to previes `REF`.

### Insert in place or Jump

If there's no `REF` in current line, then insert a new `REF` under the cursor's current position.

I want to put the In-note ref anywhere inside the note.

And I can jump around by those REF
