> I learned a lot from their codes

## Advantage

- Plain text and could be imbeded in any place
- One REF could be insert into multiple lines
- Jump with shortcuts with easy

## Commands

There're only two commands of this plugin

### Insert or Jump to next ref

If there's no `REF` in current line, then create a new `REF` under cursor.
Else jump to next `REF`.

### Jump to previews

Jump to previes `REF`.

## Why this plugin

I want to put the In-note ref anywhere inside the note.

And I can jump around by those REF
